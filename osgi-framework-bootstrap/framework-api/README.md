# Framework API

This module provides the functionalities to export Command Line Interface arguments to
the bundles built in the bootable jar by the **Common App* plugin and activated by the code
in the `osgi-framework-bootstrap` module.

See the `README.md` file in the `buildSrc` module to know how code of OSGi bundles can
retrieve the `args` used to run the bootable jar of the application.

See KDoc in source code for additional info.
