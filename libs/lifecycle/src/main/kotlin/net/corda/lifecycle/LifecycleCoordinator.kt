 * Interface for coordination of lifecycle events for a component.

 * component lifecycle. Behind the scenes, a coordinator is responsible for ensuring that these events are delivered to
 * some event handler.
 *
 * The coordinator guarantees that posted events are processed in the order they are processed, and that events will not

     * Events that are scheduled to be processed when the library is not running will not be delivered to the user event
