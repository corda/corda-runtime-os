 * A service managing the configuration in the process.

 * The [ConfigurationReadService] is responsible for reading configuration from the message bus and exposing this to
 * other services in the system. Configuration is expected to be dynamic, so services must be prepared to respond to
 * configuration changes.
 *
 * Note that calling start or stop on this service is idempotent, so it is safe for other services to call start to make
 * sure that the service is up.
