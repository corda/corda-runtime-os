# Corda Runtime OS

[![Build Status](https://ci02.dev.r3.com/buildStatus/icon?job=Corda5%2Fcorda-runtime-os%2Frelease%252Fos%252F5.0)](https://ci02.dev.r3.com/job/Corda5/job/corda-runtime-os/job/release%252Fos%252F5.0/)

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

Corda is a centrally managed open source project. R3 retains full control of the code and the release cycle. This is necessary because the code in the Corda Open Source repository will be regularly checked out by R3 customers running production services.

Corda Open Source is available under Apache 2.0 licensing terms.

<h2>Getting Involved</h2>

This open-source release enables you to explore how Corda 5 works, rebuild it, and experiment with deploying it locally. It is not intended to facilitate full CorDapp development. We are very happy to accept comments and contributions. Please send us a pull request with your feedback. We can then review, test, and maintain in future releases, as appropriate.
