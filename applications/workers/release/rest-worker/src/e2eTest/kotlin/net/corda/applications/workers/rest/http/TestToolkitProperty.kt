/**
 * The reason why this is implemented as extension of [ReadOnlyProperty] rather than as
 * extension from [TestToolkit] as the former gives all access to the [Class] of the
 * testcase which contains this property, giving an opportunity to "personalize" implementation
 * for a specific test.
 *
 * Such personalization may, for example, include REST usernames that are matching the name of the test class.
 *
 * Rather than using this class, please consider using [net.corda.applications.workers.rest.utils.E2eCluster] to gain
 * access to multi-cluster deployment as well as other functions available.
