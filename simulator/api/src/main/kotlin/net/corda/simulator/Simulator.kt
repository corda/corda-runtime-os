/**
 * Simulator is a simulated Corda 5 network which will run in-process. It allows a lightweight "virtual node" to be
 * created which can run flows against a given member. Note that the flows in nodes do not have to be symmetrical;
 * an initiating flow class can be registered for one party with a responding flow class registered for another.
 *
 * Simulator uses lightweight versions of Corda services to help mimic the Corda network while ensuring that your
 * flow will work well with the real thing. These can be mocked out or wrapped if required, but most of the time the
 * defaults will be enough.
 *
 * Instances of initiator and responder flows can also be "uploaded"; however, these will not undergo the same checks
 * as a flow class "upload". This should generally only be used for mocked or faked flows to test matching responder or
 * initiator flows in isolation.
 *
 * @flowChecker Checks any flow class. Defaults to checking the various hooks which the real Corda would require
 * @fiber The simulated "fiber" with which responder flows will be registered by protocol
 * @injector An injector to initialize services annotated with @CordaInject in flows and subflows
