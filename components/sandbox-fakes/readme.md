# Sandbox team fakes

# TODO and QUESTIONS

* Name and path of the module? One test module per team with all the fake implementation?
* Worth writing unit test for the fakes? for example for the yaml files.
* Do we need to register the fake implementations in the lifecycle coordinator?
* Should fakes be a SINGLETON?
* Is it a name convention to start all fake implementations with Fake...Service.kt?
* Name of the file configurable or hardcoded?
