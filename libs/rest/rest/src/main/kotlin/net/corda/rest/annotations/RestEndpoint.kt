/**

 *
 * - If an endpoint successfully creates a resource, it should return a [ResponseEntity] with [ResponseCode.CREATED] (status code 201).
 * - If an endpoint successfully updates a resource or does some processing without creating a new resource, it should return a
 * [ResponseEntity] with [ResponseCode.OK] (status code 200).
 * - If an endpoint performs processing asynchronously, it should return a [ResponseEntity] with [ResponseCode.ACCEPTED] (status code 202).
 * The response payload for such an endpoint should contain a representation of the status of the request.
 * - If an endpoint method does some processing but has no result to return, the method can have no return type and by default
 * [ResponseCode.NO_CONTENT] (status code 204) is returned, unless an exception is thrown.
 *
