/**
 * Use this enum when you want to customize the HTTP status code returned in success responses and error scenarios in HTTP APIs.
 *
 * This enum will define all HTTP status codes and their causes. They also include a reason code which will help to identify particular
 * error responses and aid in debugging and support issues.
 *
 * This code will be on response messages and forms part of the public API. Adding message with new reason codes is not considered a
 * breaking change. Changing status or reason codes after release is considered a breaking change.
 *
 * Status codes:
 * 2XX - indicates a request was successfully received, understood and accepted.
 * 3XX - indicates further action needs to be taken in order to fulfill a request.
 * 4XX - indicates a problem with the request. Requests can be re-submitted, usually with updated arguments and may succeed.
 * 5XX - indicates a problem occurred on the server side that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
 *
 * @param statusCode the http status code for the http response.
