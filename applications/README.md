# Applications

This module contains application code.

Applications should be a thin layer that composes some number of components/libraries, 
implements startup/specific logic etc. 

* Examples: This should contain an example application
  * The goodbyeworld module should live here.


* Tools: This should contain tooling around the node, rather than node processes themselves.
