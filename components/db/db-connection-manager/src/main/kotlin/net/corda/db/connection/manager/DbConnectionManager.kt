/**
 * The [DbConnectionManager] is responsible for creating and managing [EntityManagerFactory] objects
 * for databases for which connection details itself are stored in the cluster DB.
 * Internally, the [EntityManagerFactory] objects could be cached, so the [getOrCreateEntityManagerFactory] method
 * could create the [EntityManagerFactory] on demand or return one from a cache.
 *
 * The [DbConnectionManager] needs to be configured to be able to connect to the cluster DB
 * in order to fetch other DBs' connection details.
 * The [EntityManagerFactory] for the cluster DB itself is also cached and exposed.
 *
 * The [getOrCreateEntityManagerFactory] method can be invoked with a [CordaDb] and [DbPrivilege] parameter to
 * support cases for "well known" DBs (e.g. RBAC). For DBs that are dynamically added during the lifecycle of the
 * Corda cluster, e.g. VNode Vault or VNode Crypto DBs, the name, [DbPrivilege] and [JpaEntitiesSet] must be provided,
 * where name is a unique name identifying the DB (e.g. vnode_123_vault) and [JpaEntitiesSet] contains all the JPA
 * entities managed for this DB. The [JpaEntitiesSet] could be a "fixed" set (e.g. vnode crypto DB), or a dynamic set
 * depending on the CorDapps related to the VNode.
 *
 * The [DbConnectionManager] will transition to [LifecycleStatus.UP] once it has checked it has access to the cluster DB.
 *
 * @constructor Create empty Db connection manager
