# WHAT ARE THESE TEST CPKS?

They are simple "hello world" `cpk` files that contain a flow that just returns a `String`.

Used by the integration tests.

The `cpb` dependencies:

* CPB ONE
  * its own cpk flow
  * hello-world-cpk-one

* CPB TWO
  * its own cpk flow
  * hello-world-cpk-two

* CPB ONE
  * its own cpk flow
  * hello-world-cpk-one
  * hello-world-cpk-two
  * hello-world-cpk-three
