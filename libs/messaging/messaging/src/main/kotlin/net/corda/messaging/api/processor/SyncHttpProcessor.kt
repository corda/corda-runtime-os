/**
 * This interface defines a contract for processors that handle HTTP requests of type [REQUEST] from a synchronous HTTP subscription.
 *
 * The subscription executes the [process] function synchronously and returns a HTTP response to the caller containing the
 * serialized [RESPONSE] object.
 *
 * Implementations of [process] can throw a [CordaHTTPServerTransientException] when a transient error occurs during processing.
 * This will trigger the subscription to return a HTTP response with status `503`. The HTTP client is responsible for handling retries.
 *
 * Implementations of [process] must be idempotent to handle scenarios where the same request is attempted multiple times. Repeated
 * processing of the same request should produce the same result. For example, deduplication measures can be implemented in the [process]
 * function. This is not handled by the synchronous HTTP subscription.
