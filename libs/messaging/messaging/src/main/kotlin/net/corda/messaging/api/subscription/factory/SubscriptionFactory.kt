     *   - The subscription will only receive events that occur after subscription is started. Older events are ignored.
     *   - Events will be processed at most once. If errors are thrown processing records then they will be skipped.
     *   - When no executor is provided, events are consumed and synchronously committed back to the source.
     *   - When an executor is provided, events are consumed on the executor thread, though this can cause
     *   events to be published in a different order than when handled synchronously.
