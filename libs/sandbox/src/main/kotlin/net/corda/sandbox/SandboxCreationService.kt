 * A service for creating sandboxes.

 * The service is initialised with a single [Sandbox], the platform sandbox. This sandbox contains the public and
 * private bundles named by the `PLATFORM_SANDBOX_PUBLIC_BUNDLES_KEY` and `PLATFORM_SANDBOX_PRIVATE_BUNDLES_KEY`
 * configuration admin properties. This sandbox is initialised lazily; the named bundles must be installed and the
 * configuration admin properties set before this service is first interacted with.
 *
 * Sandboxes thereafter are created from CPKs. Every CPK sandbox is granted visibility of the platform sandbox.
 *
 * The platform sandbox receives special treatment in terms of visibility; its public bundles have visibility of even
 * private bundles in the CPK sandboxes.
