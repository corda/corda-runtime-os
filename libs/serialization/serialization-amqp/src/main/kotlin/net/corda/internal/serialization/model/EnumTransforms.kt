     * graph. It makes a single pass over the set of edges, attempting to add each new edge to any existing chain of edges, or
     * starting a new chain if there is no existing chain.
     *
     * For each new edge, one of the following must true:
     *
     * 1) There is no existing chain to which the edge can be connected, in which case it starts a new chain.
     * 2) The edge can be added to one existing chain, either at the start or the end of the chain.
     * 3) The edge is the "missing link" between two unconnected chains.
     * 4) The edge is the "missing link" between the start of a chain and the end of that same chain, in which case we have a cycle.
     *
     * By detecting each condition, and updating the chains accordingly, we can perform cycle-detection in O(n) time.
