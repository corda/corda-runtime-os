/**
 * Marks a function of an @[HttpRpcResource] annotated interface to be exposed as a POST endpoint by the HTTP RPC
 * generated web service.
 *
 * - If an endpoint successfully creates a resource, it should return a [ResponseEntity] with [ResponseCode.CREATED] (status code 201).
 * - If an endpoint successfully updates a resource or does some processing without creating a new resource, it should return a
 * [ResponseEntity] with [ResponseCode.OK] (status code 200).
 * - If an endpoint performs processing asynchronously, it should return a [ResponseEntity] with [ResponseCode.ACCEPTED] (status code 202).
 * The response payload for such an endpoint should contain a representation of the status of the request.
 * - If an endpoint method does some processing but has no result to return, the method can have no return type and by default
 * [ResponseCode.NO_CONTENT] (status code 204) is returned, unless an exception is thrown.
 *
 * @property path The relative path of the endpoint within its resource.
 *           Defaults to an empty string, meaning that path of the enclosing [HttpRpcResource] should be used.
 * @property title The title of the endpoint, used for documentation. Defaults to the function name.
 * @property description The description of the endpoint, used for documentation. Defaults to empty string.
 * @property responseDescription The description of the response, used for documentation. Defaults to empty string.
