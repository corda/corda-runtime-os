/**
 * Crypto service which can be used to sign and generate new key pairs.
 *
 * Corda always uses a single alias to identify a key pair. However, some HSMs need separate aliases for public
 * and private keys. In such cases, their names must be derived from the single key pair alias.
 * It could be suffixes or whatever internal naming convention is used.
 *
 * Also, it is not required to keep a public key in the HSM as that will be kept by the upstream Crypto Services.
 *
 * # Exception handling.
 *
 * As the service instances are decorated with decorators taking care of the timeout, throttling handling,
 * and exception normalisation the exceptions listed for each method below are as expected to be thrown by the decorators.
 *
 * The service should throw the most appropriate exception as it sees it, e.g.:
 * - [IllegalArgumentException] if the key is not found, the key scheme is not supported, the signature spec
 * is not supported or in general the input parameters are wrong
 * - if the internal state is wrong for an operation then the most appropriate exception would be [IllegalStateException]
 * - any other that is appropriate for the condition.
 *
 * If service encountered throttling situation and the downstream library doesn't handle that, it should throw
 * [net.corda.v5.crypto.exceptions.CryptoThrottlingException]
 *
 * The following exceptions are retried - [java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException],
 * [net.corda.v5.crypto.exceptions.CryptoException] (with the isRecoverable flag set to true),
 * some persistence exceptions like [javax.persistence.LockTimeoutException], [javax.persistence.QueryTimeoutException],
 * [javax.persistence.OptimisticLockException], [javax.persistence.PessimisticLockException] and some others.
 * Throw [java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException] only if the service should handle it before the upstream
 * library detects it.
 *
 * # About service extensions.
 *
 * The implementation of the [CryptoService] consists of the method of the implementation required and some optional
 * methods, which are called extensions. It's done this way, instead of breaking the functionality into several
 * interfaces, because the platform uses decorators to handle some common failure scenarios where using extension
 * interfaces would be awkward. If not stated explicitly in the description, the method is required.
