/**
 * A flow engine which, for the provided subflow, injects services into that subflow then calls it and returns any
 * response. Note that the simulated fiber provided must be able to look up any members that will be contacted by the
 * subflow (so if you're using the BaseSimFiber, it should be the same instance that was provided to
 * Simulator).
 *
 * @virtualNodeName the name of the virtual node owner
 * @fiber a simulated fiber through which responders should be registered
 * @injector an injector which will initialize the services in the subFlow
 * @flowChecker a flow checker
 *
 * @return the value returned by the subflow when called
