/**
 * Identifier for a lifecycle coordinator.
 *
 * This identifier is used to show which component a particular coordinator is for. This is used when looking up other
 * components to register against when implementing domino logic. It is also the key by which coordinator statuses are
 * recorded in the registry.
 *
 * Note that creating two coordinators with equal names is considered an error. Where multiple components of the same
 * name must be created in the same process, the instance ID should be used to distinguish between them. True singleton
 * components can use the componentName as the sole identifier.
 *
 * @param componentName The name of the component
 * @param instanceId If this component can be instantiated more than once, this is used to disambiguate the different
 *                   instances. Can be left `null` for singleton components.
