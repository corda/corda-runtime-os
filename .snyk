          Corda 5 does not make use of the default SSLEngine configuration when
          using Netty. It explicitly configures the SSLEngine with the endpoint
          identification algorithm set to “HTTPS”, which means a Corda gateway
          will always validate server certificate hostnames when establishing
          HTTPS connections with other gateways.

        This vulnerability does not apply to C5 as we are not parsing XML
        configuration when setting-up Jetty server. We are only using Jetty
        through Javalin which is configuring Jetty programmatically.
