/**
 * A registration of a parent coordinator to a set of underlying child coordinators.
 *
 * On registration, an instance of this is returned as the registration handle and the registration is handed to each
 * of the child coordinators. When these update their status, the registration is also updated. Overall status changes
 * are only delivered on change. The overall status is considered to be up only if all the underlying statuses are also
 * up.
 *
 * The registration must be thread safe in its update and close functions, as it is very likely that the update function
 * is called from multiple threads simultaneously.
 *
 * @param coordinators The set of coordinators that has been registered to.
 * @param registeringCoordinator The coordinator to deliver status updates to.
