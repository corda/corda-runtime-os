/**
 * This interface defines a processor of events from a [StateAndEventSubscription] on a feed with keys of type [K],
 * states of type [S], and Events of type [E].
 *
 * If you want to receive updates from a [StateAndEventSubscription] you should implement this interface.
 *
 * If the processor is slow and exceeds the timeout defined for the processor in the config, the event and state will be placed on dead
 * letter queues. The state will be set to null for the given key.
 * Note: The first state for any event will always be null for a key. If the state is null for any subsequent event records with the same
 * key, then this key has been added to the state and event dead letter queues and should be handled by the processor as appropriate.
 *
 * NOTE: Any exception thrown by the processor which isn't [CordaIntermittentException] will result in a
 * [CordaFatalException] and will cause the subscription to close.
