/**
 * Ideas borrowed from "io.kotlintest" with some improvements made
 * This is meant for use from Kotlin code use only mainly due to it's inline/reified nature
 *
 * @param duration How long to wait for, before returning the last test failure. The default is 5 seconds.
 * @param waitBetween How long to wait before retrying the test condition. The default is 1/10th of a second.
 * @param waitBefore How long to wait before trying the test condition for the first time. It's assumed that [eventually]
 * is being used because the condition is not _immediately_ fulfilled, so this defaults to the value of [waitBetween].
 * @param test A test which should pass within the given [duration].
 *
 * @throws AssertionError, if the test does not pass within the given [duration].
