/**
 * [FlowEventContext] contains information about a received [FlowEvent] and state that should be modified when passed through a
 * [FlowEventPipeline].

 * When a [FlowEventPipeline] completes the [checkpoint] and [outputRecords] of the context will be written to the message bus. Setting the
 * [checkpoint] to null will cause its mapping to be removed from the compacted topic.
 *
 * @param checkpoint The [FlowCheckpoint] of a flow that should be modified by the pipeline.
 * @param inputEvent The received [FlowEvent].
 * @param inputEventPayload The received [FlowEvent.payload].
 * @param isRetryEvent True if this event is being retried.
 * @param outputRecords The [Record]s that should be sent back to the message bus when the pipeline completes.
 * @param T The type of [FlowEvent.payload].
 * @param mdcProperties properties to set the flow fibers MDC with.
 * @param flowMetrics The [FlowMetrics] instance associated with the flow event
 * @param flowTraceContext The [TraceContext] instance associated with the flow event
 * @param metadata Metadata associated with the checkpoint in state storage
