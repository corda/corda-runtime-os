          Corda 5 does not make use of the default SSLEngine configuration when
          using Netty. It explicitly configures the SSLEngine with the endpoint
          identification algorithm set to “HTTPS”, which means a Corda gateway
          will always validate server certificate hostnames when establishing
          HTTPS connections with other gateways.
